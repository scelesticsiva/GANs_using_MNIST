# Generative Adversarial Networks using MNIST dataset in Tensorflow

Humans always have a fascination to make machines strangely human-like, one such attempt is a branch of artificial intelligence called deep learning which mimic human brains. Deep learning encompasses different architecture of neural networks which are computationally similar to our brains. There is a new sub set of deep learning known as generative models evolving in the machine learning community. They are becoming popular these days (because they are super cool! When was the last time you saw a machine creating a picture for you?) and recent advancements suggest that their applications and their impact are going to be enormous.

Here I have implemented one particular type of generative model called Generative Adversarial Network(GAN), you can find out more about them <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">here.</a>

This implementation was done with one goal in mind, which is to make the user understand the architecture of GANs and how it can be implemented on MNIST dataset (“hello world” of machine learning enthusiasts).  This implementation was done on Tensorflow, a recently open sourced machine learning library by Google.
